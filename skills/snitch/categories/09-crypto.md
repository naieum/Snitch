## CATEGORY 9: Cryptography

### Detection
- Crypto libraries: `crypto`, `bcrypt`, `argon2`, `scrypt`, `jose`
- Hashing functions: `createHash`, `md5`, `sha1` (NOT sha256 or sha512 — those are fine)
- Encryption patterns: `createCipheriv`, `encrypt`, `decrypt`

### What to Search For
- MD5/SHA1 for password hashing
- Math.random for security tokens
- Hardcoded encryption keys
- Weak cipher modes

### Actually Vulnerable
- Weak hashes for password storage
- Predictable random for security purposes
- Encryption keys in source code
- ECB mode or deprecated ciphers

### NOT Vulnerable
- MD5/SHA1 for checksums only
- Secure random functions for tokens
- bcrypt/argon2/scrypt for passwords
- Keys from environment variables
- SHA-256, SHA-384, SHA-512 in any context (these are strong hashes — not a finding)

### Context Check
1. Is the weak hash used for password storage or non-security purposes (checksums)?
2. Is Math.random used for security tokens or UI randomization?
3. Are encryption keys loaded from environment or hardcoded?

### Files to Check
- `**/auth*.ts`, `**/crypto*.ts`, `**/hash*.ts`
- `**/token*.ts`, `**/password*.ts`
- Encryption and key management utilities
